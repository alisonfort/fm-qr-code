## My process

- Sketched out a rough draft of the design on paper; labeled elements and attributes
- Wrote HTML and CSS files in Visual Studio Code
- Used Greenshot to measure pixels on design files
- Used Flexbox to display all the elements in a single column, as well as to center the content on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

I used a blur filter to make my text match the design screenshots.

```css
p {
  margin: 15px;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: var(--grayish-blue);
  filter: blur(0.4px);
}
```
